Life Planner is a simple programming language expressed in language typical for a calendar or schedule with the added functionality of being able to add constraints to a person’s schedule. The schedule or calendar and user-defined constraints are entered as a source program and the result is a new schedule or calendar that is tailored to the user’s preferences and priorities. Life Planner is targeted at busy people with little or no programming experience, therefore the language and syntax is accessible, simple and familiar. In a world where effective time management is directly correlated with success, Life Planner is here to help.
